# etch-a-sketch


This project was very difficult. I utilized lots of help from Google, primarily for the draw() in script.js. 

The draw() in script.js carries this project. The default 16x16 is created with the createGrid(). 

The draw() will get each div with the class "gridSquare". This is added to a NodeList and the for loop will color each square when the user's mouse hovers over the "gridSquare" div. I had to Google how querySelectorAll() worked. 

The opacity is adjusted only when the opacity button is clicked. I had to get help from Google to complete that. 

All other code was completed by me.
